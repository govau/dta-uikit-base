# Design System Base Theme

This is a Drupal 8 base theme using the DTA's Design System components.

Please note it is not useful on its own; it will require a sub-theme to actually provide some styling.

The main purpose of this theme is to provide site-wide theme overrides to generate Design System-suitable HTML rather than any specific styling.
